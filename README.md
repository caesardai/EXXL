# Project: wesport

Web app, Android app, and database system created collaboratively using agile software development methodology for CS353 Software Engineering at Bryn Mawr College.

## Problem statement:
People often struggle to adjust to new environments, especially transitioning from a highly socially concentrated environment such as college, where it is easy just to run into other people, to a completely different city or country. College intramural/club sports are popular ways for people to connect and find their place in the new community, whether they have previous experience in sports or not, and even more people turn to sports for community after graduating.  Sports encourage exercise and thus overall wellbeing while providing a basis for people to connect with each other and build community. However, while there are many publicly accessible locations to play sports (such as basketball courts and fields in parks for games like soccer and frisbee), our app aims to connect people who would not otherwise have the opportunity to meet with facilities and locations with the space and opportunity to play the sports they like. 

## Description:
This app aims to revolutionize post-covid online friend making by providing the users a way to meet new people in-person as a group safely. Users will be able to host or join a sporting event or outdoor activity on this app. The host can post activity  on the app with a description such as number of participants, location, event name, date, etc. Users who are looking to join a game could browse through the events within the range of distance that they are willing to travel. They could also filter the events based on their interests and availability in the day.
